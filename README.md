# cypress-extended

 Example of Cypress project which is used Playwright or Selenium libraries to extend the base functionality

## Prerequisites
 - `Git` - Download & Install Git. OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
 - `Node.js` - Download & Install Node.js and the npm package manager.

## Getting started
1. Clone the repository:
```bash git clone https://github.com/achako2012/playwright-web-e2e-example.git```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
$ cd cypress-extended
$ npm ci
```

It's highly recommended to use `npm ci` instead of `npm install`

## Running tests
You don't need to run the browser by yourself because Cypress does it. All you need to do is to run:
```bash
npm run test
```
Cypress will open a launch window, where you can choose the browser you wanted, and then the name of the test you want to launch
